        <h2><a name="what-is-pynab" class="anchor" href="#what-is-pynab"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Pynab?</h2>
        <p>Pynab is a Python interface to the YNAB4 (You Need A Budget v4) database. The purpose is to give an interface for other scripts to use to analyze or automate some tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming. This would also give users the ability to add some features, theoretically, to YNAB.</p>
        <h2><a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h2>
        <p>This project started as a fork of James Seward's alfred-ynab Alfred 2 module, <a href="https://github.com/jamesoff/alfred-ynab">https://github.com/jamesoff/alfred-ynab</a>. He included a YNAB parser for the purposes of finding the remaining budget balances for the Alfred workflow.</p>
        <p>This was only a read-only interface, and I wanted to create an interface that would allow for writing to the database. This would enable the automation of transaction entry, tracking investments by increase / decrease transactions, etc.</p>
        <h2><a name="development" class="anchor" href="#development"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/elaske/pynab/wiki">wiki</a> for this project will house any information relevant to development or use. During development, I plan to store any information I find from reverse-engineering the YNAB database in the wiki. Also, eventually, this will be where the information as to how to use this library will be located.</p>
        <h2><a name="license" class="anchor" href="#license"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>License</h2>
        <p>The original interface was licensed BSD. Whilst this remains in the repository in any form, I will be licensing this in BSD as well.</p>
        <h2><a name="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h2>
        <p>If anyone has any interest in contributing, please contact me. You can suggest a feature by adding an issue if you so desire as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I am but a lone contributor and can only work on this in my spare free time. The day job does get in the way of things like this. So, I make no guarantees as to the timeliness of completion, etc.</p>
